In this poject, we are faced with a dataset from a financial institution that seeks to leverage machine learning to determine whether a customer is eligible for a loan or not.
The dataset before us has a total of 13 features and 4269 data points. Since we are in possesion of a labelled dataset, we are to use supervised learning and since or outcome is binary in nature i.e approved or rejected we shall use KNN and Logistic regression to execute this project.
The next markdown contains the data dictionary for the dataset before us.
